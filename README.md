# Desktop Todolist
Little yellow desktop to-do list 
## The Idea
Remember Windows Vista and its little desktop gadgets such as the clock, or the puzzle, the news panel, OR _*the little sticky note*_?
This thing works pretty much just like it. It can rest in a _notify icon_ (aka, *Tray Icon*), or you can have it open in the background on your
desktop to see what you need to do.
### The good, the bad (and the ugly)
The good thing is it works. You get something done, BAM, you tag it off. You get new thing to do? you just write it down.
The bad is, there is no database. You turn off your computer and the tasks are gone as well.
And of course. The ugly! You can't close the app! â˜º 
...
..
I'm just joking with ya, but really. If you close the app, let's say, by _accident_, the app minimilises itself into the tray and stays there 
chilling, waiting for you to remember you had stuff to do. Of course. You can turn the app _off_ if you right click the tray icon and chose
the one and only option "Close".
